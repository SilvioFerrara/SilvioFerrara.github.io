description: Serious Game for Nutrition Education
---
During my university studies, I collaborated with my colleague Federico Vassallo on a project titled "The Adventure of Cate in FoodLand", a serious game focused on nutrition education, created using Unity. I oversaw the planning, design, and development of the project, and conducted thorough testing to evaluate usability, user experience, and overall game quality.

### Project Presentation: The Adventure of CATE IN FOODLAND
**Title:**: The Adventure of CATE IN FOODLAND  
**Target Audience:** 15+  
**Platforms:** PC and Mobile  
**Localization:** Italian and English  
**Engine:** Unity

**Concept**
Explore the hidden nutritional secrets and perilous challenges of FoodLand with Cate, a spirited young pirate. In this top-down adventure, players will navigate through captivating gameplay, battling enemies, solving puzzles, and assisting island inhabitants with their nutritional needs.

**Theme**
Cate in FoodLand serves as an educational tool on nutrition, imparting knowledge on food groups, properties, and promoting healthy eating habits among players.

**Key Features**
- **Objectives:** Collect foods to complete the "Healthy Plate," engage in missions, and employ nutrition knowledge to overcome challenges.
- **Player Skills:** Master movement, interact with environments, manage inventory, and strategically use items.
- **Inventory Management:** Organize food collection efficiently within designated slots.
- **Combat Mechanics:** Utilize collected items to progress and defeat formidable enemies.
- **Non-Player Characters:** Engage in dialogue with characters, fulfilling their food requests to progress in the game.
- **Enemy Dynamics:** Encounter and strategize against dangerous creatures that sense the player's presence, akin to gameplay in Metal Gear.

**Artistic Style**
Inspired by the pixel art aesthetics of classic 16-bit games like Harvest Moon and Zelda, Cate in FoodLand features vibrant, contrasting colors that facilitate easy recognition of food items and environments.

**Audio Design**
Immersive low-fi electronic music accompanies players throughout their journey, providing feedback during key actions. The dynamic main theme adapts to reflect the game's changing contexts and challenges.

- **Game Quality Test**: Evaluated with MEEGA+ (Model for the Evaluation of Educational Games).

### Results and Feedback:

**Learning Aspects: Pre-Test and Post-Test**
- Significant increase in nutritional knowledge.

**User Experience: NASA-TLX and SUS**
- Described as intuitive, easy to use, and satisfying.
- High cognitive load, but not frustrating.
